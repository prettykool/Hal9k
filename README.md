# Hello, Dave.

### So, what the fuck is this thing?

Nothing important. Just a basic program I wrote, to test out putting shit on GitHub, via. the terminal.

### What does it do, though?

A robot asks you a Y/N question. What the question is, and what its importance is, is up for you to think.

### Is that it?

Yes. What were you expecting; Linux?
